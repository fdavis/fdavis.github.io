Here it is! :smile:

That's right. StarWars on XScreenSaver using fortune for text. :neckbeard:

If you'd like to set this up I have some basic how to steps here:

1. to have xscreensaver and fortune installed
1. open up screensaver preferences
1. open the Advanced tab
1. under the 'text manipulation' pane select program and type in fortune
1. go back to on the display modes tab
1. select StarWars
1. now if you watch the preview you should see fortune text scroll by :smiley:
1. make sure the checkbox is marked so it will come up when xscreensaver activiates normally
